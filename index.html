That’s the usual plan for many folks. They get here with a blocked account, a
sponsorship, or a scholarship to cover their initial costs. Once your’re settled there, you
may use the money you make from your part-time job to take care of everything, including
food, rent, and occasional trips abroad. However, bear in mind that the schedule may vary if
you’ve been thinking about attending a private university.</div></details><hr class="my-8 border-gray-200"><details class="cursor-pointer faq"><summary tabindex=0 type=button class="flex items-center select-none focus:outline-none faq-question" onclick=toggleFaq(this)><i class="text-blue-500 transition-transform fa-solid fa-plus toggle-icon"></i>

• Travel: ~ 600 €
• First-month expenses: ~ 1,500 €(rent, deposit, etc)
• Other: ~ 1,000 €
Keep in mind, these numbers might change based on your situation, university and the city
you're headed to.

For instance, if
you're coming for a English taught program, or a job that have only English requirements, or
your au-pair speaks a language other than German, or your contract provider agrees to bring
you without the language requirement and many more scenarios. It really depends on your
unique situation, contract, and the type of visa you are applying for.
